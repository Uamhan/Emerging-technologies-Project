    "## The MNIST Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The MNIST (modified national institute of standards and technology) Dataset  is a a computer vision dataset. it consists of 60,000 training datapoints and 10,000 testing datapoints. Each datapoint consists of a 28x28 pixel image. This image represents a handwriten digit. The MNIST dataset is a sub set of the much larger NIST dataset where by the digits have been size normalised to the 28x28 pixel size and they have been centrered. This formating and pre processing allows for a normailsed dataset so that we can get as acurate as possible results from our machine learning algorythms.\n",
    "\n",
    "For machine learning classification we need fetures and labels for the data. Features being the peices of information or varibles for each datapoint and the label being the classification assigned to that datapoint. We previously discused the IRIS dataset in another notebook in this repository whereby there was 4 features and a label for each datapoint. The MNIST data set is a little more complex. For each datapoint we have a 28x28 pixel image and a label stateing what number that image is ment to represent. \n",
    "\n",
    "This 28x28 pixel image is represented by a numpy array with the shape (28,28) with each digit in the array represent a pixel. Each value iin this array ranges between 0 and 1. 0 being white 1 being black and the numbers between being varrying degrees of gray. as shown by the image below from Christopher Olahs blog on The MNIST Dataset."

    "To suit our purposes of machinelearning we need to reformat this data so that we can split it into individual features as discused earlyer. To do this we simmply flatten the 28x28 array into 784 dimensional vector. now we have 784 individual varibles or features describing the intensity of a pixel at a given point in the image. we can now have a datapoint we can use. \n",

    "with the IRIS dataset we had datapoints that had 4 features and 1 label now after flattening the arrays representing the images we have a dataset that's datapoints have 784 features and 1 label."
